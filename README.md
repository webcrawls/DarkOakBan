ðŸŽ® a silly Minecraft mod to "fix" an obsolete problem

_(eventually, they added the ability to dye the color of sign text, rendering this "solution" useless.
nobody needs to use this, probably.)_

## features

- punish any player who uses a dark oak sign
  - _(it's all configurable)_
  - broadcast a message to shame
  - smite the offender
  - ..death sentence...
  - and execute any custom commands

## backstory

many years ago, i was an epic minecraft gamer kid with a youtube channel.
this is the result of a "epic funny mod challenge" or something.

i've come back and decided to retool it for modern Minecraft because i'm bored.
